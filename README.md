# MITTR

This repository contains a **phase-based adversary simulation lab** aligned with the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

Each folder represents a phase of an attack, documented from both the **attacker** and **SOC analyst** perspectives, focusing on detection, investigation, and response using EDR and SIEM telemetry.

## Current Focus

**Phase 1 — Initial Access & Execution**

- Initial Access (TA0001) — User Execution (T1204)
- Execution (TA0002) — Malicious File Execution (T1204.002)

More phases will be added to extend the attack chain.
