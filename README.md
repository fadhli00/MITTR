# MITTR

This repository documents a **phase-based adversary simulation lab** built in a **Proxmox homelab environment**.

The lab uses segmented networks, pfSense, and security tooling to simulate real attack behavior and document detection and investigation workflows aligned with the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.
